Good Morning Aviators! This is Aditya (Kansas) Sarkar speaking. Welcome to my website "USS Roosevelt". I'm a final year undergraduate student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at IIT Mandi. My research interests largely focus on optimal control theory and am exploring multi-agent systems in theoretical reinforcement learning. I am fortunate to be advised by Sriram Sankararaman (UCLA), Serghei Mangul (USC) and Dileep A.D. (IIT Mandi) in the past. I have also worked closely with Rayan Chikhi (Institut Pasteur) and Eran Halperin (UCLA). I am supported by National Talent Search Examination Fellowship which I was awarded in 2017.
