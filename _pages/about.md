Hi, I am Aditya Sarkar, and I'm currently a third year Electrical Engineering undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Technology, Mandi. I am currently working with Prof. Serghei Mangul at the University of Southern California (USC), [Sriram Sankararaman](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~sriram/) and [Eran Halperin](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/eran-halperin/) at the Univeristy of California, Los Angeles. I am interested in the intersection of Aritificial Intelligence and healthcare, broadly known as AI-assisted healthcare.  

Please see that the following publications are not mine. I have taken website from [Ruth Johnson](https://ruthjohnson95.github.io/), a PhD student at UCLA.
